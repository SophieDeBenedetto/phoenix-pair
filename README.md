## TODO
<!-- * remove channel.leave() ? -->
<!-- * track current user typing w/ Presence and update component to display accordingly -->
<!-- * track language in Monitor gen server -->
* respond to off focus event to remove currently typing user
* can still update response and chat?
* refactor challenges_channel (build Presence helper methods? wrap up monitor interactions in channel helper methods; do we need to #getstate withing monitor functions that use Agent.update?)
* refactor current challenges reducer -> use service class to handle state updates
